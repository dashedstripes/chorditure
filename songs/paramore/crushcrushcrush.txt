[Bm]I've got a lot to [D]say to you
Yeah [A]I've got a lot to [Bm]Say
[Bm]Iâ€™ve noticed your eyes are [D]always glued to me
[A]Keeping them here and it makes no sense at all

[G]They taped over your [A]mouth
Scribbed out the [Bm]truth with their lies
Your little spies

[G] [F#]

[Bm]Crush, crush, crush, crush crush (two three four)

[Bm]Nothing [D]compares [A]to a quiet evening alone
