[C#m] I've got a lot to say [E] to you
Yeah [B] I've got a lot to [C#m] say
[C#m] I've noticed your eyes are [E] always glued to me
[B] keeping them here and it makes no sense at all

[A] They taped over your [B] mouth
Scribbled out the [C#m] truth with their lies
Your little spies x2

[A] [G#]

[C#m] Crush, crush, crush, crush crush (two three four)

[C#m] Nothing [E] compares [B] to a quiet evening alone
[A] Just [C#m] the one [B] two of us who's counting on
[C#m] That [E] never [B] happens I guess I'm dreaming again
[A] Let's be more than [B] ... this

[C#m] [B] [C#m] [B]

[C#m] If you wanna play it [E] like a game
Well, [B] come on, come on, let's [C#m] play
'Cause I'd rather waste my [E] life pretending
Than [B] have to forget you for one whole minute

[A] They taped over your [B] mouth
Scribbled out the [C#m] truth with their lies
Your little spies x2

[A] [G#7]

[C#m] Crush, crush, crush, crush crush (two three four)

[C#m] Nothing [E] compares [B] to a quiet evening alone
[A] Just [C#m] the one [B] two of us who's counting on
[C#m] That [E] never [B] happens I guess I'm dreaming again
[A] Let's be more than [B] this now

[C#m] [E] [B] [A] [C#m] [B]

[C#m] Rock and [E] roll [B] baby
Don't you know that [A] we're all [C#m] alone [B] now
I need something to sing about
[C#m] Rock and [E] roll [B] (Hey)
Don't you know, baby, [A] we're all [C#m] alone [B] now
I need something to sing about
[C#m] Rock and [E] roll [B] (Hey)
Don't you know, baby, [A] we're all [C#m] alone [B] now
Give me something to sing about

[C#m] Nothing [E] compares [B] to a quiet evening alone
[A] Just [C#m] the one [B] two of us who's counting on
[C#m] That [E] never [B] happens I guess I'm dreaming again
[A] Let's be more than [B]

[C#m] Nothing [E] compares [B] to a quiet evening alone
[A] Just [C#m] the one [B] two of us who's counting on
[C#m] That [E] never [B] happens I guess I'm dreaming again
[A] Let's be more than [B]

[B] More than [C#m] this

[G#dim] [B] [A#dim] [A] [B] [C#m]
Oh-oh oh oh oh oh
