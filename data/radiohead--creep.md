[G] [B] [C] [Cm]

When you were here [G] before, couldn't look you in the [B] eyes
You're just like an [C] angel, your skin makes me [Cm] cry
You float like a [G] feather in a beautiful [B] world
I wish I was [C] special, you're so fucking [Cm] special

[Cm] x3

But I'm a [G] creep, I'm a [B] weirdo
What the hell am I doing [C] here? I don't [Cm] belong here

I don't care if it [G] hurts, I wanna have [B] control
I want a perfect [C] body, I want a perfect [Cm] soul
I want you to [G] notice when I'm not [B] around
You're so fucking [C] special, I wish I was [Cm] special

[Cm] x3

But I'm a [G] creep, I'm a [B] weirdo
What the hell am I doing [C] here? I don't [Cm] belong here

Oooh, oooh, [G] she's running out the [B] door...
[C] She's running out, she [Cm] run, run, run...
[G] Ruuuuuuuun... [B]
[C] Ruuuuuuuuuuun... [Cm]

Whatever makes you [G] happy, whatever you [B] want
You're so fucking [C] special, I wish I was [Cm] special

But I'm a [G] creep, I'm a [B] weirdo
What the hell am I doing [C] here? I don't [Cm] belong here

I don't [G] belong here
