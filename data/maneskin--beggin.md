[Bm] I'm beggin', [G] beggin' you [C#m7]
So put your loving [F#7] hand out, baby
[Bm] I'm beggin', [G] beggin' you [C#m7]
So put your loving [F#7] hand out, darlin'


[Bm] Ridin' high, [G] when I was king [C#m7]
I played it hard and [F#7] fast, 'cause I had everything
[Bm] I walked away, [G] you want me then
[C#m7] But easy come and [F#7] easy go and it would end


[Bm] So, any time I need ya, let me go
Yeah, [G] any time I feed you, get me? No
[C#m7] Any time I see you, let me know
But I [F#7] planted that seed, just let me grow
I'm [Bm] on my knees while I'm beggin'
'Cause [G] I don't wanna lose you [C#m7]
Hey [F#7] yeah, [Bm] ratatata


[Bm] I'm beggin', [G] beggin' you [C#m7]
So put your loving [F#7] hand out, baby
[Bm] I'm beggin', [G] beggin' you [C#m7]
So put your loving [F#7] hand out, darlin'


I need you to [G] understand
[C#m7] Tried so hard to [F#7] be your man
[Bm] The kind of man you [G] want in the end
Only [C#m7] then can I begin to [F#7] live again


[Bm] An empty shell, [G] I used to be
[C#m7] The shadow of my [F#7] life was hangin' over me
[Bm] A broken man, [G] but I don't know
[C#m7] Won't even stand the [F#7] devil's dance to win my soul


What we [Bm] doin'? What we chasin'?
Why the [G] bottom? Why the basement?
Why we got [C#m7] good shit, don't embrace it?
Why the [F#7] feel for the need to replace me?
You on the [Bm] wrong way track from the good
I want to paint a [G] picture tellin' where we could be at
Like a [C#m7] heart in the best way should
You can give it [F#7] away, ya had it and you took the bait

But I [Bm] keep walkin' on
Keep rockin' [G] dawns
Keep walking forward
Now the court is [C#m7] yours
Keep browsin' halls
'Cause I don't wanna [F#7] live in a broken home
Girl, I'm beggin'


[Bm] I'm beggin', [G] beggin' you [C#m7]
So put your loving [F#7] hand out, baby
[Bm] I'm beggin', [G] beggin' you [C#m7]
So put your loving [F#7] hand out, darlin'


I'm fightin' hard
To [G] hold my own
[C#m7] Just can't make it [F#7] all alone
[Bm] I'm holdin' on
I [G] can't fall back
I'm [C#m7] just a con about to [F#7] fade to black


[Bm] I'm beggin', [G] beggin' you [C#m7]
So put your loving [F#7] hand out, baby
[Bm] I'm beggin', [G] beggin' you [C#m7]
So put your loving [F#7] hand out, darlin'
